La guerra es el arte de destruir a los hombres, la política es el arte de engañarlos.
Tras la guerra, paz; de la paz, abundancia; de la abundancia, vicio; del vicio, la guerra.
La guerra es un gran esfuerzo de todos hacia la paz.
Matadlos a todos, que Dios, ya reconocerá a los suyos
Parmenides de Elea
Francisco de Quevedo
Montesquieu
